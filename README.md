# SkinShuffle

SkinShuffle is a mod that allows you to **change, store and customise** your skin in-game. It also allows you to change your skin **without leaving the server** as long as the mod is installed on the server.

Skins are stored in Skin Presets, these presets can be created from the following sources:

- Texture URLs 
- Usernames
- UUIDs
- Files
- In-game textures (Resource Locations)

SkinShuffle works right out the bat for clients! Browse, create and edit skin presets in the Carousel and Edit Preset screens that can be accessed via Mod Menu or through the widget on the pause screen and the title screen.

When you start the game for the first time with SkinShuffle, it will automatically create a preset from your current skin and set it as the main preset! Your currently chosen preset will be shown on the widget.

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

Every part of SkinShuffle is customizable thanks to [YACL]()'s powerful configuration screen.

You can customize the speed that skins rotate in the carousel, to where they should follow your cursor, and where the preview widget should show.

<h3 id="compat-issues">Known Compatibility Issues</h3>
SkinShuffle is known to be incompatible with these mods:
- ViaFabricPlus

<h2 id="server-side-support">Server-Side Support</h2>

When SkinShuffle is installed on the server, you can change your skin in-game without having to leave the game. SkinShuffle will refresh your skin for you, and for other players instantly - even for players that do not have the mod on their client.

We have massive plans to expand server-side support in the future:

- Skin Changing Commands that allow vanilla clients to change their skins.
- Skin Preset Sharing
- Skin rendering for offline mode servers.
